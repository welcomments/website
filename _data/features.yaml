features:
  - title: Easy and fast setup
    description: |
      Start receiving comments on your JAMStack site in minutes, not hours.
  - title: Bulletproof spam protection
    description: |
      We use [Akismet](https://akismet.com/). Being the go-to spam protection system for Wordpress, they kinda have a track record
      when it comes to fighting spam.
  - title: Fully customizable
    description: |
      Since there's no iframes or other funky business, you can fully style the comments to match your own website.
  - title: Email notifications
    description: |
      Get notifications about new comments and let your visitors get notified about replies. Only if you want to, that is.
  #- title: JSON in, HTML out
  #  description: |
  #    Every comment is stored as a JSON file in your GitHub repository.
  #    Your static site generator renders it as fully static HTML.
  #    We provide templates for Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, and more.
  - title: SEO-friendly
    description: |
      Because the comments are rendered as static HTML, search engines have no problem indexing their content.
  - title: Modest Javascript
    description: |
      Our optional JS snippet is **only 2.1 kB**, making it the tiniest Javascript snippet on the comment system market.
  - title: Courier, not a deposit box
    description: |
      We deliver the comments safely to your GitHub repository, but after that, you don't need to phone our servers to
      display them on your site.
  - title: No Disqus-ting stuff
    description: |
      We're a comment system, not an ad network or data miner. We hate ads and wouldn't know how to mine data even if
      someone threatened to tickle our feet, so you're safe with us.
