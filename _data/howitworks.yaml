  - title: 1. Someone posts a comment
    description: |
      Your comment form points to `welcomments.io/api/comments`.
      Upon receiving the comment, we handle all of the validation, spam checking, sanitization, and other behind-the-scenes ceremony.
  - title: 2. We deliver it to your GitHub repository
    description: |
      After processing the comment, we turn it into a JSON file and commit it to `_data/<page-slug>/<id>.json` on the
      main branch of your GitHub repository. We also handle retrying and temporarily storing the comment for you if GitHub is being sassy.
  - title: 3. The comment becomes 100% static HTML
    description: |
      Netlify (or similar) detects the recently committed JSON file and rebuilds your site.
      Your static site generator renders the JSON as HTML.
      The site gets deployed and the comment is now embedded as fully static HTML inside your blog post.
