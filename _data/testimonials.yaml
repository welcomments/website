      Iiro is a really nice friend and makes great pizza.
      Don't know about his product though, I wouldn't trust my credit card details
      with a guy who impulse buys a 400â‚¬ water filter in a country with clean water supply.

      I've been using Welcomments on my Jekyll blog for a while.
      My articles load faster than ever.
      I can even reply to comments on my Nokia 2720.

      Welcomments is exactly the comment system I was looking for: lightweight, secure, and easy to use.
      The setup was effortless: all it took were a few clicks and some copy-paste.
      In just a few minutes, I had comments working.
      Really glad I found it. ðŸ˜„
