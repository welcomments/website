And since we're also using Welcomments, the comments are treated the same way.\n\nEach comment will be committed [to this folder on GitHub](https://github.com/welcomments/website/tree/master/_data/welcomments/november-2021-update) and Netlify will rebuild the site, resulting in fully static SEO-friendly HTML."
