If the commenter typed their email and the email hash would match a user in Gravatar, their Gravatar image would show instead of the default name initials.\n\nI feel it would create more community like feel in the comments section, when commentator would have a \"face\". I guess it's also something I've just so used to, coming from the WordPress world initially :)\n\nThanks! ",
