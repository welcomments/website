And since this blog is also using Welcomments with Jekyll, the comments are treated the same way!\n\nEach comment will be committed [to this folder on GitHub](https://github.com/welcomments/website/tree/master/_data/welcomments/april-2021-recap) and Netlify will rebuild the site, resulting in fully static SEO-friendly HTML."
